## Instructions for Software Use

### 1. Download and Extract Zip Files

Download the software and sample data, which are provided in ZIP format. Extract the files to a preferred location.

The sample dataset comprises **VNIR (Visible and Near-Infrared)** data in raw format.  
The software operates with a structured file system organized within a `Data` folder, which contains multiple sample or plant directories.

Each sample directory includes dedicated subfolders named `VNIR_SV` or `SWIR_SV`, where the corresponding hyperspectral data is systematically stored for analysis.

### 2. Launch the Software

Open the extracted software folder and double-click on `app.exe`. This will launch the home page of the software.

---

### 3. Data Extraction
 
- Select **Data Extraction** from the software interface.  
- Select the folder that contains the sample data.  
- Choose the data type as **VNIR** since the sample data is in VNIR format.  
- Click on **"Click here to process"**.  
  This will process the sample data and generate the hyperspectral data cube along with a pseudo RGB image.

### 4. Visualization of Reflectance Curve

- Click on **Visualization** and select a folder containing hyperspectral images.  
- Optionally, select a **Region of Interest (ROI)** for analysis.  
- Run the process by clicking **"Click here to process"**.

### 5. Computation of Vegetation Indices

- Click on the **Vegetation Indices** radio button.  
- Select the appropriate data type for your data.  
- Choose the folder containing the extracted hyperspectral data.  
- Optionally, select an ROI.  
- Click **"Click here to process"**.  
  The software will compute the vegetation indices and generate a CSV file saved in the software directory.
